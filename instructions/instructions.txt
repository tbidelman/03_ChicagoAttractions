Chicago Attractions Quiz!


This project folder contains the skeleton of a website about Chicago's
Tourist Attractions.  I have included 3 pages describing some popular
attractions (Art Institutue, Field Museum, and Millenium Park).  Your
task is to build out the home page for this website (index.html).
Some structure for the home page has been provided for you.  Use
example-home-page.jpg as reference.

Your homepage should include:

 - A navigation bar
     * Use the <nav> tags and <a> tags to create links to every page in the project
 - A header w/ a title and banner image
     * This does NOT use <head> or <title> tags
     * Use chicago-skyline.jpg for the banner image
 - A 'City of Chicago' section with a brief description of the city
     * http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g35805-Chicago_Illinois-Vacations.html
 - A 'Things to do' section which includes links to each attraction's individual page
     * Use the thumbnail images from the 'img' folder here
 - A footer citing tripadvisor.com (similar to the individual attraction pages)


HINTS
 - Use the <nav> <header> <section> and <footer> tags to separate your content into groups.
 - Use relative links when creating both link and image tags


BONUS
 - Add your navigation bar to the web pages for each individual attraction
 - Make the images on the homepage into links that take you to the individual attraction's page
 - Upload to Github
